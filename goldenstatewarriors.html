                The Warriors were celebrating their fourth championship in the last 8 NBA seasons. Having a comeback from Klay Thompson, 
                being injured in Game 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals and losing it to being an NBA champion again. The Big 3 stays loyal to their 
                team and having 4 championships each in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022. This 2022 NBA Finals is different from the first 3 since 
                it has another bunch of players; some of them were young like Jordan Poole, on whom they drafted, and rookies like Jonathan 
                Kuminga and Moses Moody, on whom they also drafted it to the team. They also have Andre Iguodala, who came back from the team 
                after being with the Miami Heat, and Andrew Wiggins, who had been improving well in his stay at the team. Kevon Looney, Otto 
                Porter Jr., Nemanja Bjelica, and Gary Payton II were also role players in the season that led the team to another championship. 
                Their head coach is still Steve Kerr. </p>
