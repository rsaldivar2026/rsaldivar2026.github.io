                There are many great players and rivalries in NBA history. The first one is the rivalry between Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill's team having 8-consecutive championships from 1959 to 1966. The second one is the 
                Magic Johnson and Larry Bird rivalry, which makes Lakers and Celtics a popular and classic team. Magic Johnson and the Lakers won in 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988. Larry Bird and the Celtics won in 1981, 1984, and 1986. We also have Michael 
                Jordan in the 90's, which he led the Bulls into the franchise's first 6 championships. We also have another Lakers Dynasty with Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal in the 2000, 2001, 2002, and Kobe Bryant again in 2009 and 2010. The latest rivalry 
                is between Stephen Curry and Lebron James. During their rivalry, Curry and the Warriors won three out of the four years, which were 2015, 2017, and 2018, while Lebron James and the Cavaliers only had 1 but had an iconic comeback from being 3-1 
                to 4-3 in the 7-game series of the NBA finals.
